Optional description 
## Ingredients:
* 6 egg yolks
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract OR seeds of 1 vanilla bean pod
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* additional white sugar for sprinkling
* 2 cups whipping cream

#### Optional Ingredients:
* sprinkle nutmeg
* sprinkle cinnamon
 
## Instructions:
### To make the custard:
1. Fill a large pot or tub with water and set the sous vide to 185 F.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients except for the whipping cream. Beat until it's light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
3. Slowly add the whipping cream, whisking together.
4. Strain the liquid through a sieve to remove any residues from the egg. (This step greatly improves the texture of the finished product!)

### To cook the custard in mason jars:
* Divide the mixture evenly between 4 short 1 cup mason jars or 6 1/2 cup mason jars.
* Screw the lids to the jars until they are closed tighly, but can easily be opened with your fingertips.
* Put the jars in the water bath for 1 hour.
* Once the custard is done cooking, removed the lids from the jars and dry each lid off completely.
* Let the custard cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
* Chill in the fridge at least 4 hours, overnight is better.

### To cook the custard without mason jars:
* Pour the mixture into a large ziplock bag. (A reusable silicone bag like the ones made by Stasher work well here too.)
* Seal the bag using the water displacement method.
* Put the bag in the water bath for 1 hour.
* Once the custard is done cooking, pour it into 4 large or 6 small ramekins.
* Let the custard cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
* Chill in the fridge at least 4 hours, overnight is better.

### To serve the crème brûlée:
* Sprinkle a thin, even layer of white sugar over the tops of the desserts. Make sure the entire surface is covered. When heat is applied, any exposed custard will curdle.
* Using a torch, torch the sugar until it has carmelized.
* Alternatively, sugar topping can be broiled in the oven for 1-3 minutes.


### Pairs well with:
* fresh berries
* whipped cream
* feeling fancy
