## Ingredients:
* 10 oz lean ground beef
* 8 oz fresh Gemelli pasta
* 1 oz parmesan cheese
* 390 g crushed tomatoes
* 12 g fresh basil
* 1 yellow onion
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1/2 oz breadcrumbs
* 1 oz red wine vinegar
* spice mix:
   * 2 g red chili flakes
   * 1 g paprika
   * 1 g dried oregano
   * 1 g garlic powder

## Instructions:
