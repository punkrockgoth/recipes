A basic sourdough boule that is sure to impress. Don't be scared off by the prep time. Most of that is hands off!

## Ingredients:
* 740 grams or 5 3/4 cups white flour
* 60 grams or 3/4 cup + 1/2 tbsp whole wheat flour
* 620 grams or 2 3/4 cups water
* 22 grams or 1 tbsp + 1 tsp fine sea salt
* 2 grams or 1/2 tsp instant dried yeast
* 360 grams [sourdough starter](sourdough-starter.md)
 
## Instructions:
1. First thing in the morning, feed the [sourdough starter](sourdough-starter.md)
2. Between 6 and 8 hours after feeding the starter, mix the whote and whole wheat flours with the water in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 30-45 minutes.
3. Add the sourdough starter, salt and yeast to the flour mixture and mix thoroughly.
4. Fold the dough over itself 3 times (like you'd fold a paper in thirds).
5. Cover and let sit for 2-2 1/2 hours.
6. Fold the dough over itself 3 times, likein step 4.
7. Cover and let sit until dough is double its original size. This takes roughly 5 hours.
8. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Flour a line down the middle of the dough and cut in half using a dough scraper.
9. Shape the two halves of the dough into balls. Place each ball into a floured proofing basket.
10. Place the baskets in the fridge overnight.
11. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Let your dutch oven preheat with the oven.
12. Invert one of the baskets onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a razor blade or a sharp knife, score the ball.
13. Taking care to not touch the Dutch oven, put the ball inside and cover.
14. Bake covered for 30 minutes.
15. Bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes, until medium dark brown.
16. Carefully tilt the Dutch oven onto the counter to release the bread. 
17. Repeat steps 12-16 with the second ball.
18. Bread should be cooled before slicing.
