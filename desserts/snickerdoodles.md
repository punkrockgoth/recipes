## Ingredients:
Cookies
* 1 cup Unsalted Butter (softened) - salted butter can be used, just omit added salt
* 1 1/2 cups Sugar
* 2 large Eggs
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla
* 1 3/4 cup Flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tartar (for less tang, use 1 teaspoon)
* 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1 teaspoon Salt

Cinnamon Sugar Mixture
* 1/4 cup Sugar
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons Cinnamon


 
## Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer. 
3. Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined. 
4. In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon. 
5. If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.
6. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.
