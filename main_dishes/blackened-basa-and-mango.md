Chef's Plate Recipe
## Ingredients:
* 2 basa fillets
* 5 oz millet
* 1 kent mango
* 4 oz grape tomatoes
* 1 baby cucumber
* 3 oz cherry belle radishes
* 1 lime
* 1 tbsp honey
* Blackening spice mix:
  * 3 g paprika
  * 1 g dried oregano
  * 1 g dried thyme

 
## Instructions:
1. In a medium pot, add the millet and 1 1/2 cups of warm water. Season with salt and bring to a boil over high heat.
2. Once boiling, cover with a tight fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15-18 minutes until the millet is soft but still firm to the bite. Remove pot from heat and fluff the millet with a fork.
3. Prep the produce: thinly slice the baby cucumber, peel and thinly slice the mango into matchsticks, halve the grape tomatoes, quarter the time, thinly slice the radishes.
4. Season the basa fillets with the blackening spice mix.
5. In a large non-stick frying pan, add 1 tbsp of cooking oil over medium heat.
6. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the basa. Cook for 3 minutes per side (or until the basa reaches 140 F). Remove the basa from the pan.
7. In a small bowl, add the honey, juice from half of the lime and 1 tbsp olive oil. Whisk to combine.
8. In a large bowl, add the millet, baby cucumber, radishes and mango. Drizzle with the honey-lime dressing and toss well to coat.
9. Plate the millet salad and top with the blackened basa. Squeeze the remaining lime juice over top.
