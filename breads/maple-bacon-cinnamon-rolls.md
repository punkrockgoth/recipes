## Ingredients:
#### Dough:
* 1 1/2 Tbsp Active Dry Yeast
* 1 1/2 Tbsp granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 8 Tbsp butter melted
* 3/4 cup whole milk warmed
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp salt
* 5 cups all purpose flour plus more for dusting counters

#### Cinnamon Sugar Layer:
* 8 Tbsp butter softened
* 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp maple sugar
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
* 12 slices thick center cut bacon

#### Frosting:
* 8 ounces full fat cream cheese softened
* 4 Tbsp butter softened
* 2-3 cups powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 1 tbsp maple syrup

## Instructions:
1. Cook the bacon, stopping before it gets crisp then chop
2. Lightly stir the yeast, sugar and warm water together in the bottom of a mixing bowl
3. Let sit 5-10 mins (until double is size) to activate the yeast
4. With a mixer on low add the milk, butter, sugar, egg and salt – mix until smooth.
5. Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time (you might not need the full 5th cup) until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and clean the bowl – do not over add flour – it will end up too dense.
6. Knead until the dough stretches without tearing.
7. Pour the dough into a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and let rise someplace warm until doubled in size, about 60 mins.
8. Preheat the oven to 350
9. Flour the counter top and pour the dough onto it. Roll the dough out into a long rectangle, about 15×26 inches and about 1/4 inch thick
10. Spread the butter over the dough ensuring that butter reaches all of the edges.
11. Spread the sugars, cinnamon and maple syrup over the buttered dough. It will be thick.
12. Sprinkle the chopped bacon evenly on top of the cinnamon sugar mix.
13. Starting at one of the 15 inch sides roll the dough up.
14. Slice into 12 rolls, 1 1/4 inch thick
15. Place the rolls in a 9×13 pan let and rise slightly, until poofy, about 30-45 mins.
16. Bake 18-23 mins - When the buns are golden brown and don’t feel squishy anymore they're done!
17. Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and spread across the top


### Variations:
* If you don't have maple sugar, white sugar works fine

### Pairs well with:
* more bacon
