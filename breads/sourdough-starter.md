The basis of all sourdough recipes. A scale makes this easier, but is not required.

## Ingredients:
* 500 grams or 3 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
* 500 grams or 2 1/4 cups water

 
## Instructions:
### Create the starter from scratch:
1. Day 1: Mix the flour and water in a tub with a lid. Cover and let rest in a warm place.
2. Day 2: Throw away 3 quarters of the flour and water mixture. Mix in another 500 grams each of flour and water.
3. Repeat step 2 daily for 3-4 more days.
4. The starter is ready to be used for baking when it is bubbly, goopy and smells pungent. 

### Maintaining a Starter
1. Pour out 1/2 of the starter. 
2. Mix together equal weight starter, water and flour. If you're going by volume, use 1 part starter, 1 part water, 2 parts flour.

## Hints
* Weighing the tub you keep your starter in will make it easier to keep the right amount of starter for subsequent feedings.
* Once the starter is established, you can go longer in between feedings by keeping your starter in the fridge.
* White flour can be used in place of whole wheat flour, but you'll have to feed your starter more often.
* To reduce waste, use the discard starter in a variety of different recipes. Google "sourdough discard recipes" for some ideas.
