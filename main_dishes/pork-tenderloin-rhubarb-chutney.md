## Ingredients:
* 1 10 oz pork tenderloin
* 4 oz rhubarb

* 1/2 oz sliced almonds
* 1 red onion
* 1 oz cider vinegar
* 3/4 oz golden brown sugar
* 1 tbsp mayonnaise
 
## Instructions:
1. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Cut the rhubarb into 3/4 inch pieces.
3. Halve, peel and small dice half of the red onion. Thinly slice the other half.
4. In a medium pot, add 1 tbsp cooking oil over medium heat. 
5. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the diced red onion. Cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally until slightly softened.
6. Add 3/4 cup warm water. Season with salt, cover with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil over high heat.
7. Once boiling, add the cracked wheat. Cover and remove from heat. Set aside for 16 minutes to rehydrate. Fluff the cracked wheat with a fork.

15. Once simmering, reduce the heat to medium low and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally until slightly reduced.
16. Add the rhubarb mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Fold in to combine and remove the pot from heat.
17. In a large bowl, add the mayonnaise, remaining cider vinegar and 1 tbsp olive oil. Whisk to combine.
